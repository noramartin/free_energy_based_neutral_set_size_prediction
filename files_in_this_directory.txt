A Python Implementation of the new free-energy-based method is given in the file "free_energy_based_N_estimation.py". Running "python2 free_energy_based_N_estimation.py -help" will return instructions for using this code.


The following data from the paper is included as csv files:

- The file "lowenergy_and_mfe_neutral_set_size_predictions35_Nsamples5000nm3.csv" in the folder "data_predictions"'" contains data for Fig 2 in the paper: these are reference predictions for mfe set sizes/low-energy set sizes with Jörg et al.'s NNSE and our custom adaptation. The columns contain the following information: "Nmfe" for the mfe set sizem "lowenergy_y" for low-energy set size (here the value of y is given by -10*x, where x is the low-energy cutoff; this was done to avoid formatting errors by avoiding minus signs and decimal points) and "heuristic_plus15_10" for the heuristic x = 1.5 - n (where n is the number of base pairs). This data is for a sample of 5000 structures of length L=35 without isolated base pairs.

- The file "lowenergy_and_mfe_neutral_set_size_predictions35_Nsamples5000nm3.csv" in the folder 'data_samplefree_predictions' contains data for Fig 3 in the paper. The columns 
 contain the following information: the reference data for low-energy set sizes for x= -7 kcal/mol and x = 0kcal/mol (column names starting with "lowenergy_") as well as the corresponding predictions with the new method (column names starting with "prediction_").

- Otherwise, the folder "data_samplefree_predictions" contains the data for Figure 5 in the paper and the corresponding figures in the supplementary material, where the analysis is repeated for different sequence lengths. The sequence lengths are given in the filenames. Files whose filenames include "_lp" contain data that includes isolated base pairs. For each structure, there is one column with the reference data with Jörg et al.'s NNSE (column name 'Nmfe'). The other columns contain predictions from the four different sample-free neutral set size indicators: our new free-energy-based calculation, the two-versatility model by Manrubia and colleagues, the contiguity statistic by Cowperthwaite et al. and the number of stacks, as suggested by Dingle et al.

- Similarly, the folder "specific_structural_groups" contains the data for Figure 6 in the paper. The filenames are "structural_core_CCoooooooooooDD" for row A of Figure 6, "structural_core_CCoooCCoooDDooDD" for row B, "fixednbp_median_balanced" for row C and "fixedshape_fixednbp_abacbc" for row D. For each structure, there is one column with the reference data with Jörg et al.'s NNSE (column name 'Nmfe'). The other columns contain predictions from the four different sample-free neutral set size indicators: our new free-energy-based calculation, the two-versatility model by Manrubia and colleagues, the contiguity statistic by Cowperthwaite et al. and the number of stacks, as suggested by Dingle et al.
